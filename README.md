### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a currently working in the logistics and haulage industry but make out time each day to learn Front End Concepts.
I am passionate about learning and working hard to become a world class developer.

I am currently learning Javascript and React JS on Scrimba and I challenge myself to solidify concepts I learn by solving challenges on Frontendmentor.io

I am open for Front End Internships and entry roles.

Thanks for checking out my profile.
